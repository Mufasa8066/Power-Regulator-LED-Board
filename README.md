# Power-Regulator-LED-Board

After completing a PCB Design Course provided by Altium, we were assigned a project to apply and test our skills in PCB Design.

In this project, we will be creating a power regulator LED Board that will be place directly onto an Arduino UNO, and it is also known as shield board. This board will have 2 main functionalities: 
- It will power a bank of LEDs
- It will provide power to an Arduino UNO

# Requirements
The functional requirements of the board are as follows:
- Receive power from a 12 V DC input
- Regulate power down to 5 V DC
- Deliver 12 V DC power to a bank of 2 LED lights in parallel
- Provide 5 V DC power to the main Arduino Uno board
- Provide enough current to power the Arduino and the LEDs
- Regulate power with at least 90% efficiency
- LEDs must be SMD parts with high power output (at least 10 W each)
- Power input connection is provided by standard 16 AWG wire
- Components must be placed only on the top layer
- Total board thickness must be standard thickness (approximately 62 mils)

Since the board will be mounted onto the Arduino UNO, its dimensions will be based on those of the UNO.

These are the schematics, made from Altium Designer's schematic editor:
