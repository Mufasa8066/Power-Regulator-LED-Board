# Power-Regulator-LED-Board

After completing a PCB Design Course given by Alitum, we were given a project to go over to test our skills in PCB Design. 

In this project, we will be creating a power regulator LED Board that will be place directly onto an Arduino UNO, and it is also known as shield board. This board will have 2 main functionalities: 
- It will power a bank of LEDs
- It will provide power to an Arduino UNO

# Requirements
The functional requirements of the board are as follows:
- Receive power from a 12 V DC input
- Regulate power down to 5 V DC
- Deliver 12 V DC power to a bank of 2 LED lights in parallel
- Provide 5 V DC power to the main Arduino Uno board
- Provide enough current to power the Arduino and the LEDs
- Regulate power with at least 90% efficiency
- LEDs must be SMD parts with high power output (at least 10 W each)
- Power input connection is provided by standard 16 AWG wire
- Components must be placed only on the top layer
- Total board thickness must be standard thickness (approximately 62 mils)

Board dimensions will based on the dimensions of the Arduino UNO.

These are the schematics;
