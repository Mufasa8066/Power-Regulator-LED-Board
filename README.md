# Power-Regulator-LED-Board

After completing a PCB Design Course given by Alitum, we were given a project to go over to test our skills in PCB Design. 

In this project, we will be creating a power regulator LED Board that will be place directly onto an Arduino UNO. This board will have 2 main functionalities: 
- It will power a bank of LEDs
- It will provide power to an Arduino UNO
